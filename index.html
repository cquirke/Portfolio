  <div class="about-text">

    <p>
      I’m Collin, a Mechanical Engineering student at Liberty University with a strong focus on mechanical
      design, structural analysis, and propulsion systems. My academic and project experience centers on
      aerospace and high-performance mechanical systems, particularly solid rocket motors, UAV platforms,
      and propulsion-related hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of engineering, I stay highly active and enjoy hiking, camping, and endurance training. I’ve
      completed several backpacking trips and trained for long-distance races, which reflects my disciplined
      mindset and long-term goal-oriented approach. I bring that same persistence and attention to detail
      into my engineering work.
